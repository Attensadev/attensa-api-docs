# Authentication

> To authorize, pass your username and password using basic auth:

```shell
curl -u username:password https://api.attensa.net/endpoint
```

Attensa uses [HTTP basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).  You can obtain a username and password by contacting us [here](http://attensa.com/contact-us/).

HTTPS is required, we do not support HTTP.
