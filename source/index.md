# Introduction

Welcome to the Attensa API! To get started, please <a href='http://attensa.com/contact-us/'>contact us</a> about getting a developer account.

The Attensa API helps you manage your users and streams outside of our web interface. The API is split into 7 different sections:

* **Briefings** - Get a list of active briefings.
* **Categories** - Get and set information about stream categories, including streams and briefings that a category contains.
* **Groups** - Get and set up user groups, including the streams and briefings a group subscribes to.
* **Items** - Get information about items.
* **Streams** - Create streams, get information about them and post new items into streams.
* **Stream Tags** - Tag streams with labels and find them later.
* **Reports** - Retrive a list of downloadable weekly reports on user activity.
* **Users** - Set up new users, get information about users and subscribe users to streams.
